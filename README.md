# Programming Languages Quiz

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

A website showcasing the skills I have cultivated in Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Markdown, as of the completion of my second week at Epicodus, particularly emphasizing the use of jQuery branching. It takes the form of an online quiz to help the user determine what programming language they would be most suited to study. This is the most advanced document of my abilities as a coder and programmer that I have produced so far.
